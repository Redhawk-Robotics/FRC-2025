# What did I do today?
Today I was able to use phoniex x turner to be able to see the issues that the zombie bot has issues with. Currently, the swerve cannot be constructed due to the wheel's inability to have a proper connection to its absolute value placement hence leading us to see the magnetic offset which shouldn't stay at 0.
