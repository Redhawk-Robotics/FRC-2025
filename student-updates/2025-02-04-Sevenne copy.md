# What did I do today?
Please share!

Today, me and Yucari worked together. We wrote a timed template robot skeleton on a different repository and tested out if we could
retrieve data from cancoders directly in code. Unfortunately, it returns as zero and does not update periodically.

We need to continue figuring this out, because I'm pretty sure this is why the modules can't locate
themselves and reach their desired swerve states.

Heeeeelppp I am so sadddd!!!
